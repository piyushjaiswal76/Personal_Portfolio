    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <h3>C Language</h3>
    <p>
    <b><u>Description</u></b>: C is a versatile, general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level memory manipulation capabilities. It was developed in the early 1970s and has been influential in shaping the programming world. C is commonly used in system programming, embedded systems, and developing operating systems.</p>
    <p>
    <b><u>Key Features</u></b>: Pointers, manual memory management, strong control over hardware, extensive standard library, and a rich ecosystem of development tools.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>C++</h3>
    <p>
    <b><u>Description</u></b>: C++ is an extension of the C programming language with added support for object-oriented programming. It is known for its flexibility, allowing developers to work at both a high and low level. C++ is widely used in game development, system programming, and building high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>
    <b><u>Key Features</u></b>: Object-oriented programming, templates, strong type system, multi-paradigm support, and the Standard Template Library (STL).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>
    <b><u>Description</u></b>: Java is a high-level, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is renowned for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is commonly used in web development, Android app development, and enterprise-level applications.</p>
    <p>
    <b><u>Key Features</u></b>: Platform independence, automatic memory management (garbage collection), strong support for multithreading, and a vast standard library.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>
    <b><u>Description</u></b>: Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has gained immense popularity due to its extensive standard library and a vibrant community. Python is used in web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and automation.</p>
    <p>
    <b><u>Key Features</u></b>: Clean and readable syntax, extensive standard library (Python Standard Library), dynamic typing, and support for multiple programming paradigms (e.g., object-oriented, functional).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
    <b><u>Description</u></b>: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It is supported by all major web browsers and is used on both the front-end and back-end (Node.js) for building web applications.</p>
    <p>
    <b><u>Key Features</u></b>: Event-driven programming, asynchronous operations, manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), and support for building modern web applications with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>
